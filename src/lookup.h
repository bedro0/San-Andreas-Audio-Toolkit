 * Lookup file functions modeled somewhat on the RFSA config handlers
 *
 * Should handle more things internally and better shield the user from
 * implementation details. Because the GTASA lookup files are sorted and
 * this implementation allows essentially random access, you can really
 * screw things up. To fix it, one would have to make sure the table is
 * still properly sorted when doing the insert or assign operations and
 * the whole seek pointer access might have to be rethought. Also, it
 * could use better documentation. ;)
