 * Simple Virtual File Implementation
 * Data structures and helper functions related to using memory buffers
 * instead of files for interfacing with libvorbis and libsndfile.
 * This implementation is specific to SAAT and would have to be modified
 * for general use due mostly to me having to use libsndfile datatypes.
